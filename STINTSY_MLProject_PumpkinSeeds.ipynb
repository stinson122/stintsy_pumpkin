    "The pumpkin plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family and has seasonal varieties. Confectionery pumpkins, grown in Turkey, are usually produced from the pumpkin species, Cucurbita pepo L and sometimes from the Cucurbita moschata Duchesne type. Pumpkin seeds are considered as important for human health because it contains 37 percent of carbohydrate, 35 percent to 40 percent of fat and protein along with calcium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, and zinc. Pumpkins are divided into many types, and one of these species is known as “Urgup Sivrisi”. Urgup Sivrisi is a type of pumpkin seed that has a long, white, very bright, thin, and hardly distinguishable shell with a pointed tip. The other type of pumpkin seeds is “Cercevelik”. It is a particular species grown in Turkey, Nevsehir, Karacaoren, and known as “Topak” in Turkey. <span style=\"color:#42adf5\">(*taken directly from* Details *section of the Pumpkin Seeds Dataset pdf*)</span>"

To process the original RGB images, they were converted to gray-toned images, and then to binary images to simplify the value of each pixel in the image.
